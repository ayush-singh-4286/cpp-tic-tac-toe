# C++ Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C++ using 2D vectors and STL.

## 📌 Features
- 3x3 game board using 2D vector
- Two-player gameplay (X and O)
- Position mapping (1–9 grid system)
- Win condition checking (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C++
- STL (vector, unordered_map)
- Structured Programming

## ▶ How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   g++ main.cpp -o game

2. Run the executable:
   ./game

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Game logic implementation
- STL usage
- 2D arrays and vectors
- Conditional checking and loops

Built as part of internship task.
